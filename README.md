# Bridal Shower

> ## > What is this project? ðŸ¥‡

### This is the BACKEND of a Bridal Shower website, basically it will list all the products registered in the database through the django admin panel.

### I've decided to make this API to improve my skills with Python and specifically with Django.

### I've also decided to make this project to improve my skills with AWS Services and Heroku.
